=== MODEL EVALUATION METRICS ===

1. Classification Models (Supervised Learning)
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC

2. Clustering Models (Unsupervised Learning)
   - Silhouette Score
   - Davies-Bouldin Index
   - Calinski-Harabasz Score

3. Model Comparison
   - Cross-validation mean accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance
