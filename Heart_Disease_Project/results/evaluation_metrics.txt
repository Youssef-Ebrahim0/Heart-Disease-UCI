3. Model Comparison
   - Cross-validation mean accuracy: 0.81 â€“ 0.85
   - Confusion Matrix: Generated for multiple models
   - Feature Importance: Evaluated using tree-based models (e.g., RandomForest)

Notes:
- All results are logged and visualized in the results/ directory.
- The best-performing supervised model achieved 85% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.
